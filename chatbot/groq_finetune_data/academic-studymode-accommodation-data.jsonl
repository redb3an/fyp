{"section": "2025 Fees (Malaysian & International)", "content": "In 2025, APU’s tuition fees for Malaysian students are approximately: RM19,600 for Certificate courses; RM27,200 for Foundation programs; RM46,000–50,000 for Diploma programs; RM97,400–119,600 for Undergraduate degree courses; and RM26,000–45,800 for Postgraduate (Master’s or PhD) programmes:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. International students pay additional charges on top of the domestic fees, ranging roughly from RM1,000 up to RM20,000 extra depending on the course:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. For example, a Certificate program costs about RM19,600 for local students, whereas international students pay around RM21,200 in total:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}. *(Fees are subject to change; refer to APU’s official sources for the most up-to-date figures.)*"}
{"section": "Study Durations by Programme Level", "content": "APU’s programme durations vary by level of study. Certificate programmes typically take about 1 year 4 months (approximately 16 months) to complete:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}. Foundation programmes are 1 year (12 months) long:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}. Diploma programmes generally require 2 years of full-time study:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}. Most Bachelor’s (Honours) degree programmes span 3 years, except for Engineering degrees which run 4 years to meet professional requirements:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}. Master’s degree courses usually take 1 year of full-time study to finish:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}, while PhD programmes are typically at least 3 years in duration (full-time):contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}."}
{"section": "Admission Requirements – Certificate Programs", "content": "For admission into APU’s Certificate courses (e.g. Certificate in Administrative Skills), the minimum requirement is **1 Credit in SPM** (with at least a pass in Bahasa Malaysia and Sejarah):contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}. Equivalent qualifications are also accepted – for instance, **1 O-Level/IGCSE credit (grade C and above)** or **1 UEC credit (grade B and above):contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}**. These certificate programs are designed for students who have at least one credit from secondary school, providing a pathway into diploma studies."}
{"section": "Admission Requirements – Foundation Programs", "content": "Entry into APU’s Foundation programs requires a minimum of **5 Credits at SPM** level (in 5 different subjects) including any specified key subjects, with a pass in Bahasa Malaysia and Sejarah:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}. Similarly, **5 credits in O-Levels/IGCSE** or **5 Bs in UEC** are accepted as equivalent. Different foundation pathways (e.g. Engineering, Computing, Business routes) may have particular subject requirements (for example, the Engineering route typically requires credits in Mathematics and a science subject):contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}."}
{"section": "Admission Requirements – Diploma Programs", "content": "For APU’s Diploma courses, students generally need at least **3 Credits in SPM** (in three different subjects) with a pass in Bahasa Malaysia and Sejarah:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}. Equivalent qualifications like **3 O-Level/IGCSE credits** or an appropriate certificate (e.g. a relevant certificate from a recognized institution) are also considered. These requirements ensure that diploma entrants have a sufficient secondary education foundation in key subjects before pursuing the 2-year specialized diploma curriculum."}
{"section": "Admission Requirements – Undergraduate Degrees", "content": "Admission into APU’s Bachelor’s degree programs typically requires a recognized pre-university qualification. For example, students can qualify with **2 Passes in STPM** (Malaysia’s Form 6) or **2 A-Level passes**, or with a **Matriculation/Foundation certificate (CGPA ≥ 2.0)**:contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}:contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}. A relevant **Diploma (Level 4 MQF) with CGPA ≥ 2.0** also provides entry into degree programs (often into Year 2). UEC students need at least **5 Grade B passes** in the UEC Senior Middle III examination to enter undergraduate courses:contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}. Note that specific programs may impose additional requirements – for instance, computing and engineering degrees expect credits in Mathematics and/or science subjects at SPM/O-Level:contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}. International qualifications are assessed based on equivalence to these standards as set by the Malaysian Qualifications Agency."}
{"section": "Admission Requirements – Postgraduate (Masters & PhD)", "content": "For admission into APU’s **Master’s degree** programs, the general requirement is a relevant **Bachelor’s degree** (usually with a minimum CGPA as specified by the program, often around 2.50 or higher on a 4.00 scale):contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}:contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}. Some Master’s programmes may require the prior degree to be in a related field of study, and applicants with lower CGPA might be considered on a case-by-case basis if they have sufficient professional experience. Entry into a **Ph.D. (Doctoral)** program requires a **Master’s degree** in a related discipline; occasionally, candidates with only a Bachelor’s (Honours) degree but excellent academic standing can be considered for direct PhD admission, subject to strict conditions and approval. All postgraduate applicants must also meet any specific program prerequisites and the university’s English language requirements."}
{"section": "Common vs. Specialised Modules in Programmes", "content": "APU’s academic programs are structured with a combination of common core modules and specialised modules. **Common modules** cover fundamental knowledge and skills that all students in the programme or faculty must learn, laying the groundwork in areas such as computing, business, or engineering basics:contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}. **Specialised modules**, on the other hand, dive deeper into the specific field or specialisation that a student chooses, providing focused expertise (e.g. cybersecurity, data science, marketing, etc.):contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}:contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}. For example, in the B.Sc. Computer Science degree, Year 1 includes common modules like *Introduction to Networking*, *Systems Analysis and Design*, and *Introduction to Databases*, alongside specialised modules like *Introduction to Artificial Intelligence* and *C Programming* which are specific to the computer science domain:contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}:contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}. As students progress to Year 2 and 3, they continue to take some common modules (such as innovation and research methods) and a larger number of specialised modules aligned with their chosen specialism:contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}:contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}."}
{"section": "Scholarships and Financial Aid", "content": "APU offers various scholarships and financial aid options to help students fund their studies. Notably, the **APU Merit Scholarships** provide tuition fee waivers based on academic excellence – high achievers can earn substantial awards, even up to a 100% tuition fee waiver for the most outstanding students:contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33}. There are also scholarships targeted at specific student groups, such as **SPM Scholarships** and **UEC Scholarships** for top-performing Malaysian students in those examinations:contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34}. In addition, APU facilitates **student loans** (for Malaysian students, e.g. PTPTN loans) and may offer other bursaries or discounts (for example, alumni or sibling discounts). Prospective students are encouraged to apply for scholarships during the admission process, and eligibility is generally determined by academic results, extracurricular achievements, and in some cases socio-economic background."}
{"section": "Campus Facilities", "content": "Asia Pacific University is equipped with modern, world-class facilities at its campus to enrich student learning and campus life. There are extensive teaching and learning amenities, including state-of-the-art **computer labs** and specialized **engineering laboratories**, where students work with the latest software, hardware and equipment relevant to their disciplines:contentReference[oaicite:35]{index=35}:contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36}.

There are **over 60 clubs and societies** active on campus, spanning academic, cultural, athletic, and special interest groups, which means there are plenty of events, activities, trips and projects happening throughout the year:contentReference[oaicite:48]{index=48}. Students are encouraged to take part in these co-curricular activities – they can join existing clubs or even start new ones, participate in competitions, or be elected to the Students’ Representative Council to develop leadership skills. APU also runs a **Student Ambassador** program, where students assist in university events and gain professional experience working with people from diverse cultures:contentReference[oaicite:49]{index=49}. Overall, APU’s campus environment is lively and supportive: learning extends beyond the classroom through industry exposure, intercultural activities, sports and workshops, ensuring students have a rewarding and holistic university experience."}

{"section": "Study mode", "content": "Foundation and Diploma programmes at APU are offered exclusively on a full-time basis (no part-time or online modes available) with the only exception being a dedicated Foundation in Computing (ODL) which allows fully online study for that particular route. APU’s Undergraduate degree programmes are similarly delivered on a full-time mode only. At the postgraduate (Master’s) level, some courses are available full-time (on campus), others as part-time ODL (fully online), and a few specializations offer both modes. For example, taught Master’s programmes like the MSc in Digital Transformation can be taken either as a full-time on-campus programme or on a part-time basis:contentReference[oaicite:50]{index=50}. Meanwhile, all of APU’s Master’s (ODL) programmes (such as the MSc in AI, Cyber Security, Data Science & Business Analytics, and several MBA specialisms) are conducted in part-time mode only, typically with a minimum duration of 2.5 years:contentReference[oaicite:51]{index=51}. At the Doctoral level (PhD, DBA), programmes are offered in both full-time and part-time modes, and certain PhD courses are also available via ODL (for instance, the PhD in Computing ODL can be pursued full-time in 3 years or part-time in 4 years:contentReference[oaicite:52]{index=52}). Finally, shorter courses such as language programmes (e.g. APU’s English language camps) are generally conducted on a full-time intensive basis."}
